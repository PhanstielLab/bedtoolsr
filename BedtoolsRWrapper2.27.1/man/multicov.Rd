\title{Counts sequence coverage for multiple bams at specific loci.}
\usage{
multicov(bams, bed, split = NULL, s = NULL, S = NULL, f = NULL,
  r = NULL, q = NULL, D = NULL, F = NULL, p = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{bams}{aln.1.bam aln.2.bam ... aln.n.bam}

\item{bed}{<bed/gff/vcf>}

\item{split}{Treat "split" BAM or BED12 entries as distinct BED intervals.}

\item{s}{Require same strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B
that overlap A on the _same_ strand.
- By default, overlaps are reported without respect to strand.}

\item{S}{Require different strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B
that overlap A on the _opposite_ strand.
- By default, overlaps are reported without respect to strand.}

\item{f}{Minimum overlap required as a fraction of each A.
- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).
- FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)}

\item{r}{Require that the fraction overlap be reciprocal for each A and B.
- In other words, if -f is 0.90 and -r is used, this requires
  that B overlap 90 percent of A and A _also_ overlaps 90 percent of B.}

\item{q}{Minimum mapping quality allowed. Default is 0.}

\item{D}{Include duplicate reads.  Default counts non-duplicates only}

\item{F}{Include failed-QC reads.  Default counts pass-QC reads only}

\item{p}{Only count proper pairs.  Default counts all alignments with
MAPQ > -q argument, regardless of the BAM FLAG field.}
