\title{Examines a "window" around each feature in A and
reports all features in B that overlap the window. For each
overlap the entire entry in A and B are reported.}
\usage{
window(a, b, abam = NULL, ubam = NULL, bed = NULL, w = NULL,
  l = NULL, r = NULL, sw = NULL, sm = NULL, Sm = NULL,
  u = NULL, c = NULL, v = NULL, header = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{<bed/gff/vcf>}

\item{b}{<bed/gff/vcf>}

\item{abam}{The A input file is in BAM format.  Output will be BAM as well. Replaces -a.}

\item{ubam}{Write uncompressed BAM output. Default writes compressed BAM.}

\item{bed}{When using BAM input (-abam), write output as BED. The default
is to write output in BAM when using -abam.}

\item{w}{Base pairs added upstream and downstream of each entry
in A when searching for overlaps in B.
- Creates symterical "windows" around A.
- Default is 1000 bp.
- (INTEGER)}

\item{l}{Base pairs added upstream (left of) of each entry
in A when searching for overlaps in B.
- Allows one to define assymterical "windows".
- Default is 1000 bp.
- (INTEGER)}

\item{r}{Base pairs added downstream (right of) of each entry
in A when searching for overlaps in B.
- Allows one to define assymterical "windows".
- Default is 1000 bp.
- (INTEGER)}

\item{sw}{Define -l and -r based on strand.  For example if used, -l 500
for a negative-stranded feature will add 500 bp downstream.
- Default = disabled.}

\item{sm}{Only report hits in B that overlap A on the _same_ strand.
- By default, overlaps are reported without respect to strand.}

\item{Sm}{Only report hits in B that overlap A on the _opposite_ strand.
- By default, overlaps are reported without respect to strand.}

\item{u}{Write the original A entry _once_ if _any_ overlaps found in B.
- In other words, just report the fact >=1 hit was found.}

\item{c}{For each entry in A, report the number of overlaps with B.
- Reports 0 for A entries that have no overlap with B.
- Overlaps restricted by -w, -l, and -r.}

\item{v}{Only report those entries in A that have _no overlaps_ with B.
- Similar to "grep -v."}

\item{header}{Print the header from the A file prior to results.}

\description{
Examines a "window" around each feature in A and
reports all features in B that overlap the window. For each
overlap the entire entry in A and B are reported.
